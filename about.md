## COVID-19 Church Resource List

As churches across the UK, and the world, have had to transition their day-to-day activities online this handbook exists to serve local church leaders, communication teams, and church staff during the coronavirus outbreak.

All of the resources listed here have been crowdsourced from [volunteers](/contributors) who want to serve and equip the church at this time. This resource started in the UK, and as a result some of the resources may be UK specific, however the vast majority will be applicable regardless of geography.

### I thought this was a Google Doc?

Yes! This used to be a Google Doc running on top of the [Google Docs Enhancement Suite](https://gdes.app/). As the number of people using it grew, there were increasing issues with the site performance. The team at [OneSheep](https://onesheep.org) have been working hard to make the resource list easier to update, search for relevant resources, and share links.
