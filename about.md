## COVID-19 Church Resource List

As churches across the UK, and the world, have had to transition their day-to-day activities online this handbook exists to serve local church leaders, communication teams, and church staff during the coronavirus outbreak.

All of the resources listed here have been crowdsourced from [volunteers](/contributors) who want to serve and equip the church at this time. This resource started in the UK, and as a result some of the resources may be UK specific, however the vast majority will be applicable regardless of geography.
